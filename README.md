# Surfs_up
# Overview of analysis
The project is to analyze and visualize the temperature statistics for June and December to determine if running a surf shop is viable business proposition. In order to get the temperature data , two seperate queries are run, one being for June and the other being December. Nect, information is converted to dataframe. From the dataframe, summary statistics is created using the .describe() method. Here is what we found:

# Results
-- In June mean temperature was at 74.9 with min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

-- Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 for December -- making for a higher disparity in December a (0.5 difference in the two different seasons)

# Summary
-----------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of the analysis of temperature trends before opening the surf shop.The analysis shows that mean and max temperatures are close for both the monthts though the  minimum varies a little. However,  other attributes can be measured such as precipitation to give a more holistic view on weather:   additional queries can include include query to measure precipitation and can include more months in Summers and winters.
